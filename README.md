# 08 Project 1: Professional Materials

Now that you've had some practice with APIs and have a project to share, you'll be updating your portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer-competitive.

If you are opting out of career services, this is *still a required assignment*. Part of being a web developer means being a part of a community. Having a place to share your projects is *necessary* if you're applying for jobs, but it's also *critical* on your journey as a developer.

## Homework Requirements

* Updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Updated resume

* Updated LinkedIn profile

## Grading

| Requirement      | Weight |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Portfolio        | 40%    |
| GitHub Profile   | 40%    |
| Resume           | 10%    |
| LinkedIn Profile | 10%    |

## Instructions

1. [Updated Portfolio](#updated-portfolio)

2. [Updated GitHub Profile](#updated-github-profile)

3. [Updated Resume](#updated-resume)

4. [Updated LinkedIn](#updated-linkedin)

## Updated Portfolio

üíÅ Need help updating your Portfolio? Check out the [career services milestone resources for online presence](https://mycareerspot.org/onlinepresence).

Your updated portfolio should:

1. Display your contact information. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a separate email that you will only use for coding, also known as a developer email, and/or a call forwarding service, such as [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/).

2. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

3. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

4. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

	* Project title

	* Link to the deployed version

	* Link to the GitHub repository

	* Screenshot of the deployed application

5. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design

Unfortunately, this is where it gets a little bit subjective. Your site should look
"polished." Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

## Updated GitHub Profile 

Employers (and potential collaborators) _will_ look at your GitHub profile, so put your best face forward. 

Your GitHub profile must contain at least the following items:

1. Profile picture or avatar

  * A photo or an avatar other than the default Github identicon. (a semi-professional to professional photo or an avatar photo are preferred)

2. Biography

3. Email address. If you don't want to share your personal email or phone number, use a developer email.

4. Link to your deployed portfolio

5. At least 2 pinned repositories:

	* Navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and go to your profile.

	* Click "Customize your pins"

	* Click the checkboxes for your project and 2-3 homework assignments that you would like to share

6. Follow a few of your classmates and/or other developers. They are the beginning of your professional network and being a developer is as much about being a part of the community as it is writing code.

7. README files. Every pinned project should contain a README file with:

	* Title of app

	* Live link to deployed app

	* List of technologies used

	* 1-2 sentences explaining what the app is

	* 2-3 Screenshots / gifs of the app

	* License (usually MIT)
	
	* Contact information for you and any collaborators

8. Commit history. Every pinned repository should have at least 20 commits.

## Updated Resume

* 3 of your strongest projects/homework assignments with brief description, languages used, and URL

# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Your Task

Welcome to this week's homework! This is an even-numbered week, so you won't be given any starter code. Instead, you'll create a web application from scratch! This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can‚Äôt be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies. 

With these points in mind, in this homework you‚Äôll set yourself up for future success by applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll get to practice your new skills while creating something that you will use during your job search. It‚Äôs a win-win that you'll likely be grateful for in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later in the course.

Let‚Äôs take a look at what a user story written from the perspective of a hiring manager might look like. As you might remember from your first homework, we follow the AS AN / I WANT / SO THAT format. 


## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager‚Äôs needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```


## Mock-Up

The following animation shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
